- 👋 Hi, I’m Justin Gallo (@justin-gallo).
- 👀 I’m interested in making a career-shift from Mechanical Engineering to Web Development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on: 
    - Refining my Javascript skills through personal projects.
    - Increasing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. 
    - Learning backend programming and beginning to touch on full-stack projects. 
- 💞️ I’d love to gain some experience contributing to open-source projects.
